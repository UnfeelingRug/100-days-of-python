<h1>Damien's Favourite Games</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Games of All Time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Super Mario Sunshine</h3>
<p>This one is a no-brainer - it's my first game I ever played, and I have great memories of it.</p>

<h3>Outer Wilds</h3>
<p>I love the aesthetic, the different planets, how deep the exploration goes, the implementation of the time-loop, and how you always have something new to investigate.</p>

<h3>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</h3>
<p>A great expansion on the original, with a hilarious narrator and a wide range of ways to find new content and story paths.</p>

<h3>XCOM 2: War of the Chosen</h3>
<p>Challenging, strategic gameplay with a lot of character customization and upgrade options; fun enemies to fight, cool missions, and it feels really satisfying to get a good plan together.</p>

<h3>Monster Hunter World</h3>
<p>Honestly just a really solid game - great to play with friends, tons of gameplay options whether you're a sword user, bonkmaster, dootstick enjoyer, anything. Tons of challenge, tons of variety.</p>
