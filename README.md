# UnfeelingRug's 100 Days of Python Archive
I'm working my way through Dr. Angela Yu's *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*. 

This github repository is to track my progress through the course, with access to every exercise completed in my own code. I am currently working through the **Beginner** lessons and challenges.

*Note: My solutions do not always use the same input and output phrasing that the challenges do. I changed the wording to make each program's intention more clear for myself when revisiting the files.*
